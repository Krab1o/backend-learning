Some notes about this learning project

I don't want to use ORM on this project for now. I want to write some SQL on 
my own.

In other stuff, it's gonna be as simple as it is in the task, I guess.

UPD:

1. I refused to use ORM at all
2. I didn't design 3 layers' communication very well but it was the first time
so I think it'll be better next time.
3. I think I'm gonna try sqlx on my next project.
4. I should learn SQL more :)
5. I learned how to structure projects with handler-service-repository pattern.
6. I'm gonna refactor this code to reuse it in my own website with my own articles
