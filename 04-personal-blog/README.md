This project was intentionally made bad firstly. I just wanted to try saving 
data from CRUD to JSON storage again. Also I combined both API and static 
serving in one server which is easy to maintain as I saw. And lastly, 
I created frontend part which makes requests with vanilla JS (it's terribly
lame). 

That's why I don't want add some good stuff here like redis, JWT auth and other.

Someday maybe it will be rewritten using at least separate node.js server as
a frontend. But now it's kinda boring doing it with vanilla js and all this shit.
